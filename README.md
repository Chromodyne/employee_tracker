**Note:** This repository contains my source code for an employee tracker created for Challenge 12 as part of GA Tech's 2022 Coding Bootcamp.

## Description ##

Every business needs a way to keep track of their employees. This employee tracker aims to be a solution to that commonality by making the tracking of employees and their relevant information easy through an intuitive terminal based prompt system. This application makes use of NodeJS with the inquirer, console-table, and mysql2 packages which interface with a MySQL backend database. 

Users are able to easily consult or update a database of their employees by using a series of interactive prompts. The application grants the user ability to add and view departments, roles, alongside
new employees to their database. The user can also update an existing employee role in just a few seconds by entering the relevant information requested by the prompts. When viewing the different tables the user can easily see important information about their business at a glance.  For example, the different deparments as well as the roles available at their business complete with details on the role's title, salary, and department the role is included under. Users can also view a table of their employees with their full names, complete role information discussed above, and department as well as who, if any, their manager may be.

Supercharge your business with this no-nonsense employee tracker!
